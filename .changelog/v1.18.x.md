# Release v1.18.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

UX and autonomy improvements for CoS dashboard and autonomous jobs.

## Features

- **GSD tab info section** — added explanatory note to the GSD dashboard describing what it monitors and how to use GSD commands
- **Moltworld script-based execution** — converted moltworld exploration job from AI agent to standalone script handler, reducing resource usage and removing unnecessary agent spawning
- **Pre-task git pull** — agents now automatically pull the latest code from origin before starting work on any project, ensuring they always work on the most recent version. If a merge conflict is detected, a high-priority conflict resolution task is created for an agent to handle before the original task retries
- **App detail dashboard pages** — each app now has a dedicated routable dashboard at `/apps/:appId/:tab` with five tabs: Overview (status, PM2 processes, JIRA, quick actions, edit), Tasks (recent agent history), Automation (per-app task type overrides), Documents (PLAN.md/CLAUDE.md/GOALS.md viewer), and GSD (project phases and concerns). Sidebar nav dynamically lists all apps as sub-links for deep navigation
