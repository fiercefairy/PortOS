# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Ship five next actions that transform PortOS from siloed features into a connected, protected, and searchable system
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Data Backup & Recovery

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Data Backup & Recovery)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-26 -- Plan 02-01 complete

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: ~2 min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-genome-migration-cleanup | 1 | 108s | 108s |
| 02-data-backup-recovery | 1 | 135s | 135s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (108s), 02-01 (135s)
- Trend: stable (~2 min/plan)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Keyword-first search for M46 (semantic search layers on later)
- Local external drive for backup (NAS/rsync added later)
- Build Apple Health endpoint before purchasing app
- Genome-to-health and taste-to-identity as priority insight domains
- Used PATHS.meatspace (existing constant) for genome migration — no new constant needed
- Moved genome data files with mv (not copy) to prevent stale digital-twin copies
- createReadStream only available on 'fs' not 'fs/promises' — fixed import in backup.js
- Exit code 24 from rsync means files vanished mid-transfer (acceptable for active systems)
- startBackupScheduler is async (reads settings) — called with .catch() in index.js like other async inits
- [Phase 02-data-backup-recovery]: RestorePanel uses inline expandable within snapshot row — avoids URL-less modal per CLAUDE.md
- [Phase 02-data-backup-recovery]: Restore requires dry-run preview before enabling Restore button — prevents accidental destructive restore

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Health Auto Export JSON schema needs validation against current app version (v7+)
- Phase 3: Apple Health XML timezone handling (local TZ vs UTC) needs decision during planning
- Phase 4: Curating scientifically grounded correlation rules is domain work, not just engineering
