   - Are existing features working well toward our goals?
   - Are there features that could be improved or refined?
   - Are there features that are underperforming or causing friction?

4. Choose ONE action to take (in order of preference):
   a) IMPROVE an existing feature that isn't meeting its potential
      - Identify what's not working and why
      - Make targeted improvements to increase effectiveness
   b) ADD a new high-impact feature
      - Something that saves user time, improves the developer experience, or makes CoS more helpful

   - Test that updates don't break functionality

5. Update dependencies carefully:
   - Update patch versions first (safest)
   - Then minor versions
   - Major versions need more careful review

6. After updating:
   - Run npm test in server/
   - Run npm run build in client/
   - Verify the app starts correctly

7. Commit with clear changelog of what was updated and why`,

  'release-check': `[Self-Improvement] Release Check — dev → main

Check if the dev branch has accumulated enough work for a release, and if so, create a PR to main, wait for Copilot code review, iterate on feedback until clean, and merge.

NOTE: The repo has a GitHub ruleset that automatically requests a Copilot code review on every push to a PR targeting main. You do NOT need to manually request reviews — just create/push the PR and wait.

## Step 1: Evaluate Readiness

Read the current changelog and version:
- \`cat .changelog/v*.x.md\` (the one with literal "x", not a resolved version)
- \`node -p "require('./package.json').version"\`

Count substantive entries (lines starting with "###" or "- **" under Features, Fixes, Improvements sections). If fewer than 2 substantive entries exist, stop and report: "Not enough work accumulated for a release." Do NOT create a PR.

## Step 2: Verify Clean State

Run these checks (stop if any fail):
1. \`git fetch origin\` and ensure dev is up to date: \`git status -uno\` should show "Your branch is up to date"
2. \`cd server && npm test\` — all tests must pass
3. \`cd client && npm run build\` — build must succeed

## Step 3: Create or Find PR

Check for existing PR: \`gh pr list --base main --head dev --state open --json number,url\`

If a PR exists, use it. If not, create one:
\`\`\`bash
gh pr create --base main --head dev --title "Release $(node -p \\"require('./package.json').version\\")" --body "$(cat .changelog/v*.x.md | head -60)"
\`\`\`

Capture the PR number and URL.

## Step 4: Wait for Copilot Review

Copilot review is triggered automatically on push. Poll every 15 seconds until the review appears:
\`\`\`bash
gh api repos/atomantic/PortOS/pulls/PR_NUM/reviews --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer") | .state'
\`\`\`

Wait until you see APPROVED or CHANGES_REQUESTED. Timeout after 5 minutes of polling.

## Step 5: Address Feedback Loop (max 5 iterations)

### 5a. Fetch unresolved review threads

Use gh api graphql (JSON input to avoid shell escaping issues with GraphQL variables):

\`\`\`bash
echo '{"query":"query{repository(owner:\\"atomantic\\",name:\\"PortOS\\"){pullRequest(number:PR_NUM){reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{id,isResolved,comments(first:10){nodes{body,path,line,author{login}}}}}}}}"}' | gh api graphql --input -
\`\`\`

### 5b. If no unresolved threads: skip to Step 6 (Merge).

### 5c. If unresolved threads exist, evaluate each one:

For each comment, read the referenced file and critically evaluate the suggestion:
- **If the suggestion is valid and improves the code**: apply the fix
- **If the suggestion is a false positive, overly pedantic, or would make the code worse**: do NOT change the code

Either way, resolve every thread — the goal is zero unresolved threads before merge.

After evaluating all threads:
- If any code changes were made: run \`cd server && npm test\` to verify, then commit and push:
  \`git add <files> && git commit -m "fix: address Copilot review feedback"\`
  \`git pull --rebase --autostash && git push\`

### 5d. Resolve ALL threads via GraphQL mutation (both fixed and dismissed):

For each thread, use the thread node id from 5a:
\`\`\`bash
echo '{"query":"mutation{resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:\\"THREAD_NODE_ID\\"}){thread{isResolved}}}"}' | gh api graphql --input -
\`\`\`

### 5e. Wait for new Copilot review if code was pushed (repeat Step 4)

If you pushed changes in 5c, the push automatically triggers a new Copilot review. Poll for it, then loop back to 5a. If no code changes were made (all threads were false positives), skip straight to Step 6.

If after 5 iterations there are still unresolved threads, stop and report what remains.

## Step 6: Merge

Only merge when Copilot's most recent review has NO unresolved threads:
\`\`\`bash
gh pr merge PR_NUM --merge
\`\`\`

If merge fails (e.g., branch protections), try: \`gh pr merge PR_NUM --merge --admin\`

## Step 7: Report

Summarize:
- Version released
- Key changes (from changelog)
- Number of review iterations needed
- Any unresolved issues

IMPORTANT: Always use \`git pull --rebase --autostash\` before pushing (dev branch gets auto-bumped by CI). Never use \`git push\` alone.`
