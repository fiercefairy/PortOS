# Release v1.14.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Genome migration cleanup — completed the meatspace data migration so genome, ClinVar, and epigenetic services read/write from the correct `data/meatspace/` directory, with all stale path references updated across services, routes, client navigation, and documentation.

## Features

- **Apple Health ingest pipeline** — `POST /api/health/ingest` accepts Health Auto Export JSON, validates with Zod, deduplicates by metric+timestamp, and persists to day-partitioned files at `data/health/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- **Apple Health query service** — `GET /api/health/metrics/:name/daily` returns aggregated daily values, `GET /api/health/metrics/:name` returns summary stats, `GET /api/health/range` returns available data range
- **Apple Health correlation endpoint** — `GET /api/health/correlation` merges HRV, steps, alcohol, and blood test data for cross-domain health analysis
- **System health namespace relocation** — moved system health endpoints from `/api/health` and `/api/health/system` to `/api/system/health` and `/api/system/health/details` to free the `/api/health` namespace for Apple Health data
- **Data backup engine** — rsync-based incremental backup from `./data/` to a configured external drive path, with SHA-256 manifest generation for integrity verification after each snapshot
- **Backup REST API** — `GET /api/backup/status`, `POST /api/backup/run`, `GET /api/backup/snapshots`, `POST /api/backup/restore` with Zod request validation
- **Backup cron scheduler** — daily backup at 2 AM (configurable via `settings.backup.cronExpression`), registered with the existing eventScheduler and started at server boot
- **Backup client API** — `getBackupStatus`, `triggerBackup`, `getBackupSnapshots`, `restoreBackup` added to `client/src/services/api.js` for widget consumption
- **BackupWidget dashboard component** — health status indicator (green/yellow/red), manual "Backup Now" trigger with toast feedback, expandable snapshot list, inline restore panel with dry-run preview and selective subdirectory filter

- **Cross-domain insights engine** — `insightsService.js` with 5 exported functions: genome-health correlations (rule-based, groups markers by clinical category and matches blood test values), taste-identity theme generation (LLM, cached to `data/insights/themes.json`), and cross-domain narrative (LLM, cached to `data/insights/narrative.json` with previousText for diff)
- **Insights REST API** — `GET /api/insights/genome-health`, `GET /api/insights/themes`, `POST /api/insights/themes/refresh`, `GET /api/insights/narrative`, `POST /api/insights/narrative/refresh` — all endpoints degrade gracefully with `{ available: false, reason }` when source data is missing
- **Insights client API** — `getGenomeHealthCorrelations`, `getInsightThemes`, `refreshInsightThemes`, `getInsightNarrative`, `refreshInsightNarrative` added to `client/src/services/api.js`
- **Insights dashboard UI** — tabbed page at `/insights/:tab` with four deep-linked views: Overview (3 clickable domain summary cards), Genome-Health (category-grouped marker cards with confidence badges, blood value matching, collapsible provenance), Taste-Identity (LLM theme cards with evidence lists and refresh), Cross-Domain (narrative with ReactDiffViewer diff toggle on refresh)
- **Insights shared components** — `ConfidenceBadge` (color-coded strong/moderate/weak/significant), `InsightCard` (shared card shell with badge and source tags), `ProvenancePanel` (collapsible references), `EmptyState` (guided empty states with nav links)
- **Insights navigation** — "Insights" sidebar entry with Lightbulb icon, alphabetically positioned between Instances and MeatSpace

## Improvements

- **Genome migration: service data paths** — updated `genome.js`, `clinvar.js`, and `epigenetic.js` services to use `PATHS.meatspace` instead of `PATHS.digitalTwin`, completing the migration from digital-twin to meatspace storage
- **Genome migration: route comments** — updated all 18 JSDoc comments in `server/routes/genome.js` to reference `/api/meatspace/genome` (was `/api/digital-twin/genome`)
- **Genome migration: client navigation** — IdentityTab "View Full Genome" button now navigates to `/meatspace/genome` (was broken `/digital-twin/genome` dead link)
- **Genome migration: documentation** — updated `docs/API.md` and `docs/features/identity-system.md` to reflect meatspace paths for genome data files and API routes
- **Genome migration: data files** — moved `genome.json`, `genome-raw.txt`, `clinvar-index.json`, `clinvar-meta.json` from `data/digital-twin/` to `data/meatspace/` so the server reads them correctly
