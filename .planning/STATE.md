# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Ship five next actions that transform PortOS from siloed features into a connected, protected, and searchable system
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Genome Migration Cleanup

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Genome Migration Cleanup)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-26 -- Plan 01-01 complete

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: ~2 min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-genome-migration-cleanup | 1 | 108s | 108s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (108s)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Keyword-first search for M46 (semantic search layers on later)
- Local external drive for backup (NAS/rsync added later)
- Build Apple Health endpoint before purchasing app
- Genome-to-health and taste-to-identity as priority insight domains
- Used PATHS.meatspace (existing constant) for genome migration — no new constant needed
- Moved genome data files with mv (not copy) to prevent stale digital-twin copies

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Health Auto Export JSON schema needs validation against current app version (v7+)
- Phase 3: Apple Health XML timezone handling (local TZ vs UTC) needs decision during planning
- Phase 4: Curating scientifically grounded correlation rules is domain work, not just engineering
