# Release v0.25.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Peer apps display and remote agent streaming on the Instances page — see what's running on federated peers at a glance.

## Features

### Peer apps + remote agent streaming on Instances page
- **Remote apps display** — each peer card now shows the peer's apps at a glance (icon, name, port, status badge) fetched during the 30s probe cycle
- **Live remote agent cards** — running CoS agents on peers stream their output in real-time via Socket.IO relay, using the same AgentCard component as the local CoS page
- **Socket.IO peer relay** — local server connects as a Socket.IO client to each online peer, subscribes to agent events, and forwards them to the Instances page
- **AgentCard remote mode** — `remote` prop disables local-only features (process stats polling, full output fetch, feedback, kill/delete buttons) and shows a peer name badge

## Improvements

- **Brain retry button UX** — retry button shows spinner and "Classifying..." state, prevents double-clicks during AI classification

### Server-persisted theme preference
- Theme selection now saves to `data/settings.json` on the server, so it persists across browsers and machines
- Falls back to localStorage if the server is unreachable

## Fixes

- **Reduce peer announcement log noise** — `announceSelf` now only fires when a peer transitions to online (from offline/unknown), not on every 30-second poll cycle
- **Brain classification uses configured provider** — background classification now passes the brain's resolved provider/model instead of raw overrides, ensuring it uses the brain-configured provider
- **Remove git refresh button** — the DevTools Git page no longer has a manual refresh icon; just reload the page
- **Reduce CoS idle log noise** — downgrade repetitive idle-state messages (no tasks, no apps, no self-improvement eligible, learning insights) from `info` to `debug`; `emitLog()` now filters `debug` from console output (still emitted via socket for UI). Set `COS_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to restore verbose console output
- **Remove health endpoint polling** — Dashboard SystemHealthWidget now fetches once on mount instead of every 30s; removed noisy `GET /api/health` console log

## Removed

- **QueryPanel** — the JSON query panel on peer cards is replaced by the richer apps list and agent streaming views
