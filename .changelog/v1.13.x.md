# Release v1.13.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Roadmap and goals refresh — added Health & Longevity as a core goal, defined M45-M47, cleaned up completed milestones and stale backlog items.

## Features

- **App Manager: Update action** — new "Update" button in Quick Actions that runs a full update cycle: git pull (rebase + autostash), npm install for each subdir with a package.json (root/client/server), npm run setup if present, and PM2 restart. Available via REST (`POST /api/apps/:id/update`) and Socket.IO streaming (`app:update` event) for real-time progress
