# Release v1.14.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Genome migration cleanup — completed the meatspace data migration so genome, ClinVar, and epigenetic services read/write from the correct `data/meatspace/` directory, with all stale path references updated across services, routes, client navigation, and documentation.

## Features

- **Data backup engine** — rsync-based incremental backup from `./data/` to a configured external drive path, with SHA-256 manifest generation for integrity verification after each snapshot
- **Backup REST API** — `GET /api/backup/status`, `POST /api/backup/run`, `GET /api/backup/snapshots`, `POST /api/backup/restore` with Zod request validation
- **Backup cron scheduler** — daily backup at 2 AM (configurable via `settings.backup.cronExpression`), registered with the existing eventScheduler and started at server boot
- **Backup client API** — `getBackupStatus`, `triggerBackup`, `getBackupSnapshots`, `restoreBackup` added to `client/src/services/api.js` for widget consumption
- **BackupWidget dashboard component** — health status indicator (green/yellow/red), manual "Backup Now" trigger with toast feedback, expandable snapshot list, inline restore panel with dry-run preview and selective subdirectory filter

## Improvements

- **Genome migration: service data paths** — updated `genome.js`, `clinvar.js`, and `epigenetic.js` services to use `PATHS.meatspace` instead of `PATHS.digitalTwin`, completing the migration from digital-twin to meatspace storage
- **Genome migration: route comments** — updated all 18 JSDoc comments in `server/routes/genome.js` to reference `/api/meatspace/genome` (was `/api/digital-twin/genome`)
- **Genome migration: client navigation** — IdentityTab "View Full Genome" button now navigates to `/meatspace/genome` (was broken `/digital-twin/genome` dead link)
- **Genome migration: documentation** — updated `docs/API.md` and `docs/features/identity-system.md` to reflect meatspace paths for genome data files and API routes
- **Genome migration: data files** — moved `genome.json`, `genome-raw.txt`, `clinvar-index.json`, `clinvar-meta.json` from `data/digital-twin/` to `data/meatspace/` so the server reads them correctly
