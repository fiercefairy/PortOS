# Release v1.14.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Apple Health import improvements and meatspace cleanup.

## Features

- **ZIP upload for Apple Health import** — upload the Apple Health export ZIP directly instead of manually extracting `export.xml` first; server extracts and streams the XML automatically

## Improvements

- **Gitignore sub-directory lock files** — removed `client/`, `server/`, and `browser/` package-lock.json from git tracking and added them to `.gitignore`; only the root lock file is committed

## Removed

- **Meatspace TSV import** — removed unused TSV import endpoint, service, tests, validation schema, and UI
