  description: z.string().optional()
});

// Added to appSchema
processes: z.array(processSchema).optional()
```

---

### M18: PM2 Standardization

- Vite processes use `npx vite --host --port XXXX` in args
- No stray port references in .env or vite.config

---

### M19: CoS Agent Runner

Isolated PM2 process for spawning Claude CLI agents, preventing orphaned processes when portos-server restarts.

#### Problem
When multiple CoS agents are running and the main portos-server restarts (due to code changes, crashes, or manual restart), child processes spawned via `child_process.spawn()` become orphaned. The parent loses track of them because the `activeAgents` Map is in memory.

#### Solution
A separate `portos-cos` PM2 process that:
1. Runs independently from `portos-server`
2. Manages agent spawning via HTTP/Socket.IO bridge
3. Doesn't restart when `portos-server` restarts
4. Maintains its own state file for PID tracking

#### Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐     HTTP/Socket.IO    ┌─────────────────┐
│  portos-server  │ ──────────────────►   │   portos-cos    │
│    (5554)       │     spawn/terminate   │     (5558)      │
│                 │ ◄──────────────────   │                 │
│  subAgentSpawner│     events/output     │  cos-runner     │
└─────────────────┘                       └────────┬────────┘
                                                   │
                                                   │ spawn
                                                   ▼
                                          ┌───────────────┐
                                          │  Claude CLI   │
                                          │   Processes   │
                                          └───────────────┘
```

### M20: AI Provider Error Handling

Enhanced error extraction and display for AI provider execution failures, with automatic CoS investigation task creation.

#### Problem
When AI provider executions fail (e.g., invalid model, API errors), the devtools/runner UI only showed exit codes without meaningful error information, making debugging difficult.

#### Solution
1. **Error Extraction**: Extract meaningful error details from CLI output
2. **Error Categorization**: Classify errors by type (model_not_found, auth_error, rate_limit, etc.)
3. **Suggested Fixes**: Provide actionable suggestions for each error category
4. **CoS Integration**: Create investigation tasks for actionable failures
5. **UI Enhancement**: Display error details, category, and suggestions in history list

#### Error Categories
| Category | Description | Actionable |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| model_not_found | Model doesn't exist in provider | Yes |
| auth_error | API key invalid or unauthorized | Yes |
| api_error | Generic API request failure | Yes |
| rate_limit | Rate limiting triggered | No (transient) |
| quota_exceeded | Billing/quota issue | Yes |
| network_error | Connection refused/timeout | No (transient) |
| timeout | Process timeout (SIGTERM) | No |
| command_not_found | CLI tool not installed | Yes |
| permission_denied | File/directory access denied | Yes |
| unknown | Unrecognized error pattern | No |

---

### M21: Usage Metrics Integration

Enhanced usage tracking to capture all AI provider executions across CoS agents and DevTools runner.

#### Problem
The Usage page existed but displayed zero data because the tracking functions were never called when runs executed.

#### Solution
1. **Usage Service Integration**: Added `recordSession` and `recordMessages` calls to runner.js and subAgentSpawner.js
2. **Mobile Responsive Design**: Redesigned usage page with responsive Tailwind breakpoints
3. **Unified Tracking**: Both manual DevTools runs and CoS agent executions now record usage

#### Data Tracked
| Metric | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Sessions | createRun, createAgentRun | Incremented when any AI execution starts |
| Messages | run completion | Recorded on successful run completion |
| Tokens | Output-based estimate | ~4 characters per token estimation |
| Provider Stats | Per provider | Sessions, messages, tokens by provider |
| Model Stats | Per model | Sessions, messages, tokens by model |
| Daily Activity | Per day | Sessions, messages, tokens by date |
| Hourly Activity | 24-hour array | Session counts by hour of day |

---

### M22: Orphan Auto-Retry

Automatic retry for orphaned agents with investigation task creation after repeated failures.

#### Problem
When agents become orphaned (server restart, runner crash, etc.), the task remained stuck and the system didn't automatically retry or investigate the issue.

#### Solution
1. **Auto-Retry**: Reset orphaned tasks to pending for automatic retry (up to 3 attempts)
2. **Retry Tracking**: Track retry count in task metadata (orphanRetryCount)
3. **Investigation Task**: After max retries, create auto-approved investigation task
4. **Evaluation Trigger**: Trigger task evaluation immediately after orphan cleanup

#### Retry Flow
```
Agent Orphaned
    └─► cleanupOrphanedAgents() marks agent as completed
    └─► handleOrphanedTask() checks retry count
        ├─► retryCount < 3: Reset task to pending, trigger evaluation
        └─► retryCount >= 3: Mark task blocked, create investigation task
```

#### Solution

1. **COS-GOALS.md Mission File**: Created `data/COS-GOALS.md` with mission statement, active goals, task priorities
2. **Always-Working Behavior**: CoS ALWAYS returns work - falls back to self-improvement if apps are on cooldown
3. **Expanded Task Types**: Added 4 new self-improvement types (cos-enhancement, test-coverage, documentation, feature-ideas)
4. **Configuration Changes**: Shorter intervals (1m eval, 30m cooldown), MEDIUM priority for idle reviews

---

### M29: Comprehensive App Improvement

Extended the CoS self-improvement system to apply the same comprehensive analysis to managed apps (not just PortOS itself).

#### Problem
The CoS had a sophisticated self-improvement system with 12 different analysis types for PortOS itself, but managed apps only received simple idle reviews.

#### Solution
Created an app-agnostic self-improvement system that applies comprehensive analysis to any managed app:

1. **10 Analysis Types for Apps**: Security audit, code quality, test coverage, performance, accessibility, console errors, dependency updates, documentation, error handling, and TypeScript typing
2. **Rotation System**: Each app tracks its last improvement type and rotates through all 10 types
3. **App Activity Tracking**: Extended `appActivity.js` to track `lastImprovementType` per app
4. **Configuration Toggle**: New `comprehensiveAppImprovement` config option (default: true)

---

### M30: Configurable Task Intervals

Per-task-type scheduling: daily, weekly, once, on-demand; schedule UI tab; execution history tracking.

---

### M31: LLM-based Memory Classification

Replaced pattern-based memory extraction with intelligent LLM-based evaluation using local LM Studio.

See [Memory System](./docs/features/memory-system.md#llm-based-classification-m31) for details.

---

### Security Audit (2026-01-08)

Comprehensive security audit performed by CoS Self-Improvement agent.

#### Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

1. **Command Injection in Git Service** (CRITICAL - FIXED)

   - File: `server/routes/screenshots.js`
   - Fix: Added `sanitizeFilename()` and path validation

#### No Issues Found (Secure Patterns)
- Command execution uses allowlist
- PM2 operations use spawn with shell: false
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- No dangerouslySetInnerHTML in React
- API keys stored server-side only
- JSON content type required for mutations

---

## M34: Digital Twin Personality Enhancement

### Vision

Transform the Digital Twin from a **document capture system** into a **quantitative personality modeling and prediction system** that can accurately embody a human's values, decision patterns, and communication style.

### Current State Assessment

| Strength | Gap |
|----------|-----|
| Rich document storage (14 categories) | No quantitative personality dimensions |
| Multi-method enrichment | No automated extraction from behavior |
| Behavioral testing framework | No feedback loop from real usage |
| Writing sample analysis | No multi-modal capture (voice, video) |
| Contradiction detection | No personality confidence scoring |
| CoS integration | No external data source integration |

### Improvement Phases

#### Phase 1: Quantitative Personality Modeling (Foundation)

**Goal**: Add structured personality trait scoring alongside unstructured documents.

**1.1 Big Five Trait Scoring**
- Add quantified OCEAN scores (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
- Infer scores from existing documents using LLM analysis
- Allow manual override/adjustment
- Store in `meta.json` under `traits.bigFive`

**1.2 Values Hierarchy**
- Extract explicit values from VALUES.md and NON_NEGOTIABLES.md
- Create ranked values list with conflict resolution rules
- Store in `meta.json` under `traits.valuesHierarchy`

**1.3 Communication Fingerprint**
- Quantify writing style: formality (1-10), verbosity (1-10), emoji usage, sentence length avg
- Extract from WRITING_STYLE.md and writing samples
- Store in `meta.json` under `traits.communicationProfile`

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
traits: {
  bigFive: { O: 0.75, C: 0.82, E: 0.45, A: 0.68, N: 0.32 },
  valuesHierarchy: ["authenticity", "growth", "family", ...],
  communicationProfile: {
    formality: 6,
    verbosity: 4,
    avgSentenceLength: 18,
    emojiUsage: "rare",
    preferredTone: "direct-but-warm"
  },
  lastAnalyzed: "2026-01-21T..."
}
```

**API Endpoints**:
| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| GET /api/digital-twin/traits | Get all trait scores |
| POST /api/digital-twin/traits/analyze | Analyze documents → extract traits |
| PUT /api/digital-twin/traits/:category | Manual override trait scores |

#### Phase 2: Personality Confidence Scoring

**Goal**: Measure how well-defined each aspect of personality is, guiding enrichment.

**2.1 Coverage Metrics**
- For each Big Five dimension: evidence count from documents
- For each value: supporting document count + specificity score
- For communication: sample diversity, consistency across samples

**2.2 Confidence Algorithm**
```
confidence(aspect) = min(1.0,
  (evidence_count / required_evidence) *
  (consistency_score) *
  (recency_weight)
)
```

**2.3 Gap Recommendations**
- Identify lowest-confidence aspects
- Generate specific questions to fill gaps
- Prioritize enrichment categories by confidence gap

**UI Enhancement**:
- Add "Personality Map" visualization showing confidence per dimension
- Color-code: green (>80%), yellow (50-80%), red (<50%)
- Click dimension → suggested enrichment questions

---

#### Phase 3: Behavioral Feedback Loop

**Goal**: Learn from real-world twin usage to improve accuracy.

**3.1 Response Validation Interface**
- When CoS uses twin context, log the interaction
- User can mark responses: "sounds like me" / "not quite me" / "definitely not me"
- Store feedback in `data/digital-twin/feedback.json`

**3.2 Feedback Analysis**
- Periodically analyze feedback patterns
- Identify which aspects of twin are underperforming
- Generate document improvement suggestions

**3.3 Adaptive Weighting**
- Documents that correlate with "sounds like me" responses → increase weight
- Documents that correlate with misses → flag for review
- Auto-adjust document weights based on feedback patterns

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
feedback: [
  {
    id: "uuid",
    timestamp: "...",
    context: "summary of interaction",
    response: "what the twin said",
    rating: "sounds_like_me" | "not_quite" | "definitely_not",
    documentsUsed: ["doc-id-1", "doc-id-2"],
    traits: { /* which traits were relevant */ }
  }
]
```

#### Phase 4: External Data Integration

**Goal**: Reduce manual input by importing from external sources.

**4.1 Reading List Import**
- Goodreads CSV import → analyze for personality insights
- Extract: genres preferred, themes that resonate, reading patterns

**4.2 Music Profile Import**
- Spotify listening history → infer emotional patterns, energy levels
- Last.fm scrobbles → genre preferences, listening habits

**4.3 Social Media Analysis (Optional)**
- Twitter/X export → communication style, topics of interest
- LinkedIn export → professional values, career trajectory

**4.4 Calendar Pattern Analysis**
- iCal export → routine patterns, priorities by time allocation
- Meeting patterns → social preferences

**Implementation Notes**:
- All imports are user-initiated, explicit consent
- Data processed locally, not stored raw
- Only personality inferences stored, not source data

---

#### Phase 5: Multi-Modal Personality Capture

**Goal**: Capture personality from voice and video, not just text.

**5.1 Voice Analysis**
- Record voice samples describing self
- Extract: speech pace, pitch variation, pause patterns
- Infer: confidence level, emotional expressiveness

**5.2 Video Interview**
- Guided self-interview with webcam
- Analyze: facial expressions, gestures, eye contact patterns
- Generate insights about authentic presentation vs stated identity

**5.3 Audio Transcript Enrichment**
- Transcribe voice samples → analyze as writing samples
- Compare spoken vs written style differences

**Technical Approach**:
- Use Whisper for transcription
- Use open-source models for facial expression analysis
- Store only derived insights, not raw recordings

---

#### Phase 6: Advanced Behavioral Testing

**Goal**: More sophisticated twin validation beyond Q&A tests.

**6.1 Scenario Simulation Tests**
- Complex multi-turn conversations
- Role-play scenarios (negotiation, conflict, mentoring)
- Evaluate: consistency across turns, appropriate boundary-setting

**6.2 Ethical Dilemma Tests**
- Present moral dilemmas aligned with stated values
- Check if twin's reasoning matches user's value hierarchy
- Detect values actually held vs values aspired to

**6.3 Communication Style Tests**
- Generate responses, measure against communication fingerprint
- Check: formality match, verbosity match, tone match
- Quantitative scoring instead of pass/fail

**6.4 Adversarial Testing**
- Prompts designed to elicit non-me responses
- Check if twin maintains boundaries (error_intolerance)
- Verify non-negotiables are enforced

---

#### Phase 7: Twin Personas & Context Switching

**Goal**: Support multiple personality variants for different contexts.

**7.1 Persona System**
- Create named personas (Professional, Casual, Family, Creative)
- Each persona: subset of documents + weight overrides
- Context-aware persona selection

**7.2 Blending Rules**
- Define which traits change per persona vs remain constant
- Example: formality varies, core values stay constant

**7.3 Persona Testing**
- Test each persona independently
- Ensure personas don't violate core identity boundaries
