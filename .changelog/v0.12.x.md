# Release v0.12.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

This release adds branch management and automated release workflow capabilities to the DevTools Git page.

## Features

### DevTools Git — Branch Update, Comparison & Release PR Workflow
- **Update Branches button**: One-click fetch and fast-forward merge of `dev` and `main` from origin, with automatic stash/restore if the working tree is dirty
- **Branch Comparison panel**: Shows how many commits `dev` is ahead of `main`, with commit list, diff stats (+insertions/-deletions/files changed), displayed as a "Release Status" card
- **Automated Release PR**: "Create Release PR" button triggers a full CoS agent task that pushes commits, updates the changelog, creates a PR from dev to main, iterates with Copilot review feedback (up to 3 rounds), verifies CI, and merges when approved
- **Release Confirmation dialog**: Modal listing the exact steps the agent will perform, preventing accidental releases
- **Push endpoint**: New server endpoint for pushing branches to origin, used by the release workflow

- **Merged Overview tab**: Personality editing and account management unified in a single view per agent
- **Published content tab**: Promoted from a section in Tools to its own dedicated tab with engagement metrics
- **Scoped sub-tabs**: All sub-tabs (Tools, Published, Schedules, Activity) are automatically filtered to the selected agent — no more redundant agent selectors
- **Deep-linkable URLs**: Every view has a unique URL (e.g., `/agents/:id/tools`, `/agents/:id/published`)
- **Simplified sidebar**: Agents section collapsed from a 5-item expandable menu to a single link

### Dashboard — Archived App Styling
- **Greyed-out cards**: Archived apps on the main dashboard now render with reduced opacity, dimmed icon/title colors, and a subtle "Archived" badge next to the app name
- **Sorted to bottom**: Archived apps are sorted after active apps in the grid so they don't intermix with actively managed services
- **Excluded from stats**: The Quick Stats cards (Total, Online, Stopped, Not Started) now count only active apps; the header shows an "(N archived)" count when archived apps exist

## Fixes

### Managed App Port Conflict — ENV Leak & Detection
- **Fix**: When PortOS started managed apps via `startFromEcosystem()`, the PortOS server's own `PORT=5554` env var leaked into child processes. Apps with `process.env.PORT || fallback` in their ecosystem configs would bind to 5554 instead of their intended port, crashing portos-server on restart.
- **Fix**: Port detection regex in `parseEcosystemConfig()` couldn't parse `process.env.PORT || 4420` expressions — it only captured `process.env.PORT` and failed to resolve it. Now extracts the `|| fallback` value.
- **Solution**: `startFromEcosystem()` now strips `PORT` and `HOST` from the inherited env before spawning PM2, and `resolvePortValue()` handles `expr || fallback` patterns

### CoS Runner State File Corruption
- **Fix**: `loadState()` in `cos-runner/index.js` used heuristic `isValidJSON()` checks that rejected valid nested JSON (e.g., objects ending with `}}`) and missed actual corruption (extra `}` on a separate line). A concurrent `saveState()` race condition could produce partial writes, corrupting the state file.
- **Solution**: Replaced heuristic validation with direct `JSON.parse`, added atomic writes (temp file + rename) to prevent partial-write corruption, and serialized `saveState()` calls through a promise chain to eliminate race conditions

### Runner Config Access Crash
- **Fix**: `server/services/runner.js` was accessing `aiToolkitInstance.config.dataDir` and `aiToolkitInstance.config.hooks`, but the AI Toolkit object returned by `createAIToolkit()` has no `.config` property (config is internal to service closures). This caused a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dataDir')` whenever the PortOS runner shim's `executeCliRun` was invoked.
- **Solution**: Pass `dataDir` and `hooks` explicitly to the runner shim via `setAIToolkit(toolkit, config)` and store them in a local `runnerConfig` variable

## Improvements

### CoS — Learning Health Summary on Dashboard
- **Learning stat card**: Added a 5th stat card to the CoS main page showing overall task learning success rate with visual health indicators
- **Quick access**: Clicking the Learning card navigates directly to the Learning tab for detailed analytics
- **Skipped task alerts**: Shows a warning count when task types have been auto-skipped due to poor performance (<30% success after 5+ attempts)
- **Status indicators**: Card border changes color based on health — purple for good, yellow for warning states, red for critical (skipped tasks)
- **Mobile support**: Learning summary displayed as a full-width card at the bottom of the mobile stats grid

**Server changes**:
- `server/services/taskLearning.js` — Added `getLearningSummary()` function returning lightweight health metrics (healthy/warning/critical/skipped counts, overall success rate)
- `server/routes/cos.js` — Added `/learning/summary` endpoint

**Client changes**:
- `client/src/services/api.js` — Added `getCosLearningSummary()` API function
- `client/src/pages/ChiefOfStaff.jsx` — Added learning summary state, fetches summary with page data, renders clickable Learning stat card in both desktop (5-column grid) and mobile layouts

### Agents — Moltbook Account Suspension Detection & Early Termination
- **Suspension detection**: API client now attaches HTTP status codes and a `suspended` flag to errors, with `isAccountSuspended()` helper for easy detection
- **Early loop termination**: Monitor (check-posts), engage, and scheduled executor loops all detect 403 "account suspended" responses and immediately halt — preventing wasted AI generation calls and failing API requests
- **Automatic account status update**: When suspension is detected, the account is automatically marked as `suspended` in the database, preventing further scheduled actions from running
- **Activity logging**: Suspended monitors log as `failed` with the suspension reason instead of `completed`

**Server changes**:
- `server/integrations/moltbook/api.js` — Enriched error objects with `.status` and `.suspended` properties, added `isAccountSuspended()` helper
- `server/routes/agentTools.js` — Check-posts endpoint detects suspension mid-loop, halts immediately, marks account suspended
- `server/services/agentActionExecutor.js` — Monitor and engage actions detect suspension and break early

### Agents — Moltbook Challenge Detection & Response Framework
- **Challenge scanning**: Every API response body is scanned for embedded challenge fields (`challenge`, `nonce`, `verification`, `proof`, etc.)
- **HMAC-SHA256 response**: Detected challenges are automatically signed with the agent's API key and POSTed back to the challenge endpoint
- **Logging**: Challenge encounters, nonces, and response results are logged for diagnostics
- **Probe script**: New `server/scripts/moltbook-probe.mjs` polls a suspended account until it lifts, then exercises all API endpoints while logging full response bodies and headers to capture the exact challenge format

**Server changes**:
- `server/integrations/moltbook/api.js` — Added `handleChallenge()` with HMAC-SHA256 signing, scans every successful response
- `server/scripts/moltbook-probe.mjs` — New standalone probe script for challenge format discovery

### CoS — Quick Summary Widget
- **At-a-glance dashboard**: New compact status bar on the Tasks tab showing today's work, streak status, pending items, and next scheduled job
- **Today's progress**: Displays tasks completed/failed, active running count, and total time worked today
- **Streak visualization**: Shows current daily streak with fire icon that lights up orange when 3+ day streaks are active
- **Pending queue**: Highlights pending user tasks and system tasks awaiting approval
- **Next job countdown**: Shows the next scheduled autonomous job with time until due (e.g., "git-maintenance in 2h 15m")
- **Smart visibility**: Widget only appears when there's meaningful data to display, staying hidden during first-run or idle states

**Server changes**:
- `server/routes/cos.js` — Added `GET /quick-summary` endpoint that aggregates today's activity, streak data, job schedule, and pending approvals in a single efficient call

**Client changes**:
- `client/src/components/cos/QuickSummary.jsx` — New component with responsive layout, auto-refresh every 30 seconds
