# Release v1.3.x - Changelog

Released: Unreleased

## Overview

UI improvements for the CoS (Chief of Staff) dashboard.

## Features

### Collapsible CoS avatar panel
- Added toggle button to collapse/expand the CoS avatar sidebar on desktop (lg+ breakpoints)
- Collapsed state persisted in localStorage (`cos-panel-collapsed` key)
- Works with all avatar styles (SVG, ASCII/terminal, cyber, sigil, esoteric, nexus)
- Collapsed state shows a thin 48px strip with expand button and status indicator
- Mobile layout unaffected — continues to use its own compact collapse mechanism

## Fixes

### App icon rendering in schedule overrides
- Fixed Per-App Overrides showing alt text ("game", "package") instead of SVG icons

### Dashboard label wrapping
- Changed "Not Started" status label to "Offline" to prevent two-line wrapping in stat cards
