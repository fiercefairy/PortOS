# Release v0.25.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Peer apps display and remote agent streaming on the Instances page — see what's running on federated peers at a glance.

## Features

### Peer apps + remote agent streaming on Instances page
- **Remote apps display** — each peer card now shows the peer's apps at a glance (icon, name, port, status badge) fetched during the 30s probe cycle
- **Live remote agent cards** — running CoS agents on peers stream their output in real-time via Socket.IO relay, using the same AgentCard component as the local CoS page
- **Socket.IO peer relay** — local server connects as a Socket.IO client to each online peer, subscribes to agent events, and forwards them to the Instances page
- **AgentCard remote mode** — `remote` prop disables local-only features (process stats polling, full output fetch, feedback, kill/delete buttons) and shows a peer name badge

## Improvements

## Fixes

## Removed

- **QueryPanel** — the JSON query panel on peer cards is replaced by the richer apps list and agent streaming views
