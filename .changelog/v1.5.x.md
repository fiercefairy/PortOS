# Release v1.5.x - Changelog

Released: Unreleased

## Overview

Fresh-install safety: all jobs, scripts, and scheduled tasks now default to disabled so new installs don't auto-run anything. CoS defaults improved for better out-of-box experience.

## Fixes

### All jobs, scripts, and scheduled tasks enabled by default
- New installs no longer auto-run jobs, scripts, or task schedules — everything starts disabled
- Autonomous jobs: JIRA Sprint Manager and Autobiography Prompt now default to disabled
- Script runner: new scripts default to disabled (was enabled)
- Automation scheduler: new schedules default to disabled (was enabled)
- Task schedule: all 14 improvement task types now default to disabled

### Windows: CMD windows flash and steal focus
- Every `spawn()` / `exec()` / `execFile()` call was creating a visible CMD console window on Windows that repeatedly stole focus
- Added `windowsHide: true` to all 23 child process spawn sites across 11 files (pm2, git, commands, runner, cos-runner, autofixer, browser, worktree manager, script runner)

### CoS collapsed panel overflow
- Removed StatusIndicator and StateLabel from the collapsed CoS desktop strip — they overflowed the 48px width

## Improvements

### CoS defaults for new installs
- Dynamic Avatar enabled by default so the CoS avatar adapts to active agent context
- Autonomy level already defaults to Standby (no change needed, was already correct)
