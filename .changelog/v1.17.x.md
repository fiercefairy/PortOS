# Release v1.17.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Roadmap expansion with three new productivity milestones.

## Features

- **M48-M50 roadmap milestones** — added Google Calendar Integration (M48), Life Goals & Todo Planning (M49), and Email Management (M50) to PLAN.md with full phase specs, dependency graph, routes, data schemas, and nav placement
- **Core goal #11** — added "Personal Productivity & Life Management" to GOALS.md, covering calendar sync, goal tracking with AI check-ins, and email management with Digital Twin voice drafting
- **GSD dashboard tab** — new CoS tab at `/cos/gsd` that scans managed apps for `.planning/` directories and displays roadmap progress, phase status, and concerns with severity badges
- **Concerns-to-tasks pipeline** — parse GSD CONCERNS.md items (tech debt, bugs, security) with severity mapping and create CoS tasks directly from the dashboard
- **Planning context injection** — agents spawned for GSD-enabled apps automatically receive STATE.md, CONCERNS.md, and ROADMAP.md content in their prompts for richer project awareness

## Improvements

- **Moltworld exploration runs as script job** — `job-moltworld-exploration` now executes `moltworld-explore.mjs` directly via child_process instead of spawning a Claude Code agent, reducing cost while preserving LM Studio thought generation
