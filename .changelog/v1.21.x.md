## Overview

GSD tab one-click agent spawning and Claude Code launcher.

## Features

- **GSD one-click agent spawn** — each setup step now has a "Run" button that creates a CoS agent task to execute the GSD command, eliminating the need to manually open a terminal
- **Open Claude Code button** — new button in the GSD setup guide header launches Claude Code directly in the app's directory for interactive use
- **`POST /api/apps/:id/open-claude` endpoint** — spawns Claude Code as a detached process in the app's repo path
