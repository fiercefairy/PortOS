- **Easy Maintenance**: Simple process for creating and updating release notes
- **Tool Integration**: Instructions for using `gh` CLI to manage releases

## 🐛 Fixes

### Media Page Debug Logs Cleanup
- **Removed Debug Console Logs**: Cleaned up 10 `console.log` statements from `client/src/pages/Media.jsx` that were left over from AudioContext debugging - improves production code quality

### CoS Agent Provider/Model Validation
- **Provider Override Support**: Tasks specifying a `provider` in metadata now correctly use that provider instead of always using the active provider
- **Model Compatibility Validation**: When spawning agents, models are now validated against the target provider's model list - prevents invalid combinations like using Claude models with the Codex CLI provider
- **Graceful Fallback**: Invalid model/provider combinations fall back to the appropriate tier model for the actual provider with a warning log

### CoS Learning-Based Model Selection
- **Adaptive Model Upgrades**: Model selection now consults historical task performance data - task types with <60% success rate are automatically upgraded to heavier models (Opus)
- **Smarter Resource Allocation**: CoS learns from past failures and allocates more capable models to struggling task types, improving overall success rates
- **Transparent Logging**: Model selection logs now include learning-based reasons (e.g., "learning-suggested - task type has 45% success rate")

### System Task Deletion
- **Task Type Detection**: Deleting system tasks (prefixed with `sys-`) now correctly passes `type=internal` to the API, fixing "Task not found" errors when deleting auto-generated investigation tasks

## 🗑️ Removed

### Dead Code Cleanup
- **Legacy Service Files**: Removed three unused `.old.js` files from `server/services/`:
  - `providers.old.js` - superseded by current `providers.js`
  - `promptService.old.js` - superseded by current `promptService.js`
  - `runner.old.js` - superseded by AI Toolkit's runner service
- These files were unreferenced throughout the codebase and represented ~1,220 lines of dead code

### DRY Refactoring: Shared File Utilities
- **New `server/lib/fileUtils.js`**: Created shared utility module for directory and path operations
  - `ensureDir(path)` - Ensures directory exists, creating recursively if needed
  - `ensureDirs(paths)` - Ensures multiple directories exist
  - `dataPath(...segments)` - Get path relative to data directory
  - `rootPath(...segments)` - Get path relative to project root
  - `PATHS` - Centralized path constants (data, cos, brain, digitalTwin, runs, memory, agents, scripts, reports)
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Refactored 4 services (`apps.js`, `history.js`, `usage.js`, `notifications.js`) to use shared utility, eliminating identical `ensureDir` implementations and reducing boilerplate
- **Pattern for Future Refactoring**: Establishes pattern for remaining 7+ services with similar duplicated directory logic

### Chief of Staff - Navigation Improvements
- **Sidebar Sub-Navigation**: Chief of Staff sub-pages (Tasks, Agents, Scripts, Schedule, Digest, Learning, Memory, Health, Config) now appear as children in the sidebar navigation under Chief of Staff, making all tabs accessible without scrolling the page
- **Collapsible Agent Panel**: On mobile, the COS Agent avatar panel is now collapsible with a tap toggle header showing state and running status
- **Touch-Friendly Tabs**: Tab navigation buttons have 40px minimum height for better mobile accessibility
- **Scrollable Tab Bar**: Tab bar uses horizontal scroll with `shrink-0` to prevent tab overflow issues
- **Badge Support on Collapsible Sections**: Notification badges now display correctly on collapsible nav sections (both collapsed and expanded states)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Task Enhancer Directory Not Found Error
- **Fixed ENOENT error in task prompt enhancement**: The `taskEnhancer.js` was creating its own runId (`enhance-xxx`) and passing it to `createRun`, but the AI Toolkit's `createRun` ignores passed IDs and generates UUIDs. When `executeApiRun` was then called with the original `enhance-xxx` ID, the directory didn't exist.
- **Solution**: Now uses the `runId` returned from `createRun({ ... })` instead of generating a separate ID

### Fixed Multi-Line Context Loss in Agent Resume
- **Root Cause**: When resuming agent tasks, the "Additional Instructions" and "Previous Agent Context" provided in the resume form were truncated to just the first line (e.g., only "## Additional Instructions" was saved)
- **The Fix**: Task metadata values containing newlines are now properly escaped (`\n` → `\\n`) when saving to the TASKS.md file and unescaped when parsing back
- **Impact**: Resume context now correctly passes full multi-line instructions to agents, including previous agent output, error context, and user refinements
- **Test Coverage**: Added new round-trip test to verify multi-line metadata preservation through save/parse cycle

### Brain Memory Delete Handler
- **Fixed Delete Success Detection**: The MemoryTab delete handler was checking `result !== null` to determine success, but successful API responses might not return a value. Changed to track failures explicitly with a boolean flag, fixing false-positive "Deleted" toasts when delete operations failed

### Memory Approval Mobile Responsiveness
- **Touch-Friendly Action Buttons**: Approve, reject, and edit buttons in the pending approval section now have 44px minimum touch targets for accessibility on mobile
- **Responsive Card Layout**: Memory cards switch from horizontal to stacked layout on small screens, preventing cramped text and buttons
- **Mobile-Optimized Modal**: Memory edit modal includes proper mobile padding, responsive form fields, and stacked layouts for category/app dropdowns
- **View Toggle Buttons**: List/timeline/graph view buttons now have 40px minimum height for easier mobile tapping
- **Search Controls**: Search input and clear button sized appropriately for touch interaction
- **Type Filter Pills**: Memory type filter buttons increased to 36px height for better mobile accessibility

### Task Enhancement Empty Response Handling
- **Fixed "Description is required" Error**: When task enhancement returned an empty response from the AI provider, the client would proceed to submit the task with an empty description, triggering a validation error. Now both client and server validate that the enhanced description is non-empty before proceeding
- **Graceful Fallback on Enhancement Failure**: Task enhancement failures (empty result or AI error) now fall back to using the original task description instead of aborting - shows a warning toast and continues adding the task

### CLI Provider Support for AI Services
- **Fixed "API error: 0" Failures**: Services like `agentPersonalityGenerator.js` and `taskEnhancer.js` were using `executeApiRun()` for all providers, but CLI providers (claude-code, codex) have no API endpoint, causing immediate failures with status 0
- **Provider Type Detection**: Added `provider.type` check to determine whether to use `executeApiRun()` (for API providers) or `executeCliRun()` (for CLI providers)
- **Impact**: Agent personality generation and task prompt enhancement now work correctly with CLI-based AI providers like Claude Code CLI

### Reasoning Model Support (AI Toolkit)
- **Fixed Empty Responses from Reasoning Models**: LM Studio 0.4.0+ and reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and gpt-oss-20b use a separate `reasoning` field for chain-of-thought, leaving `content` empty until reasoning completes. The AI toolkit now captures both fields.
- **Automatic Fallback**: If a model returns empty `content` but has `reasoning`, the toolkit falls back to using the reasoning output rather than returning empty results
- **Metadata Tracking**: Run metadata now includes `hadReasoning` and `usedReasoningAsFallback` flags for debugging
- **Impact**: Task enhancement and other AI services now work correctly with reasoning-based local models

### Setup Script pm2 Command Not Found
- **Fixed post-setup pm2 availability**: After running `./setup.sh`, users would get "zsh: command not found: pm2" because pm2 is installed locally in `server/node_modules`, not globally
- **Added npm scripts**: New `npm run pm2:start`, `npm run pm2:stop`, and `npm run pm2:logs` scripts that use `npx` to run the local pm2
- **Updated documentation**: Setup script output and CLAUDE.md now reference the npm scripts instead of direct pm2 commands

### Critical: Fixed "Unexpected end of JSON input" Errors
- **Safe JSON Parsing**: Added comprehensive JSON parsing utilities to `server/lib/fileUtils.js`:
  - `isValidJSON(str)` - Pre-validates JSON structure before parsing (supports both objects and arrays)
  - `safeJSONParse(str, defaultValue)` - Safely parses JSON with fallback on empty/corrupted content
  - `readJSONFile(filePath, defaultValue)` - Combines file reading with safe JSON parsing
  - `safeJSONLParse(content)` - Safely parses JSONL files, skipping malformed lines
  - `readJSONLFile(filePath)` - Reads and parses JSONL files safely
- **Fixed 15+ Services**: Applied safe JSON parsing to all file-reading operations across:
  - `history.js`, `memory.js`, `notifications.js`, `usage.js`
  - `weeklyDigest.js`, `taskLearning.js`, `appActivity.js`, `taskSchedule.js`
  - `brainStorage.js`, `subAgentSpawner.js`, `digital-twin.js`, `streamingDetect.js`
  - `routes/scaffold.js`, `routes/detect.js`
- **Fixed BM25 Index & Memory Classifier**: Added pre-validation guards to `memoryBM25.js` and `memoryClassifier.js` that were using raw `JSON.parse()` without empty/malformed content checks - now gracefully handle empty files with sensible defaults
- **Root Cause**: Empty or corrupted JSON files would cause `JSON.parse()` to throw "Unexpected end of JSON input", crashing services. Now all JSON file reads use safe parsing with sensible defaults

### PM2 jlist ANSI Code Parsing
- **Fixed JSON parse errors on startup**: When PM2 has warnings (like "In-memory PM2 is out-of-date"), it outputs ANSI color codes (`[31m`, `[1m`) before the JSON array. The code was matching the `[` in `[31m` instead of the actual JSON array.
- **Robust JSON extraction**: Updated `safeJSONParse` and all `pm2 jlist` callers to look for `[{` (array with objects) or `[]` (not followed by digits) instead of just `[`
- **Affected files**: `cos.js`, `pm2.js`, `fileUtils.js`

### Memory Embeddings Provider Config
- **Fixed hardcoded localhost URL**: The memory embeddings service was hardcoded to `localhost:1234` even when LM Studio is configured as a remote provider
- **Dynamic endpoint lookup**: Now reads the LM Studio provider endpoint from `providers.json` on initialization
- **Better error handling**: Added try/catch to `checkAvailability()` to prevent unhandled promise rejections
- **UI improvements**: Memory tab now shows the actual endpoint being used and clearer error messages

### Clear Completed Agents Route
- **Fixed "Agent not found" error**: Clicking "Clear Completed" on the agents page was returning 404 because the `/agents/completed` route came after `/agents/:id`, causing Express to match "completed" as an agent ID
- **Route order fix**: Moved the specific `/agents/completed` route before the parameterized `/agents/:id` route

### CoS Self-Improvement and App Improvement Toggles
- **New config options**: Added `selfImprovementEnabled` and `appImprovementEnabled` toggles to CoS config
- **UI controls**: Both toggles now visible in the CoS Config tab with tooltips explaining their purpose
- **Granular control**: Users can now disable PortOS self-improvement tasks while keeping app improvement tasks active (or vice versa)

### Web Shell PTY Compatibility Fix
- **Node.js 25 Support**: Upgraded node-pty from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0-beta.10 to fix `posix_spawnp failed` error on Node.js 25.x
- **Error Handling**: Added error handling to shell session creation to catch PTY spawn failures and report them to the client instead of silently failing

### On-Demand Task Processing
- **Fixed Priority 0 processing**: On-demand tasks (triggered via "Run Now" in Schedule tab) were only checked during idle review (Priority 4), meaning they wouldn't run if any other tasks existed. Now on-demand requests are processed at Priority 0, before all other task types.
- **Fixed null appId handling**: When triggering an app improvement task without specifying an app, the system now correctly selects the next eligible app instead of silently ignoring the request
- **Bypass cooldown for on-demand**: On-demand app improvement tasks now bypass the app cooldown check, allowing immediate execution even if the app was recently reviewed

### PM2 Yarn Berry Compatibility
- **Fixed PM2 module resolution conflict**: When another app on the system uses Yarn Berry's `yarn pm2`, PortOS would crash with "Cannot find module ProcessContainerFork.js" errors due to PnP zip cache paths being inherited by the PM2 daemon
- **Direct PM2 dependency**: Added `pm2` as a direct devDependency instead of relying on `npx`
- **Isolated execution**: PM2 scripts now use `./node_modules/.bin/pm2` to ensure PortOS always uses its own npm-based PM2 installation regardless of system-wide Yarn Berry configuration

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/PortOS.git
cd PortOS
