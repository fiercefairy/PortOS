# Release v1.17.0 - Changelog

Released: 2026-02-27

## Overview

Split monolithic "Blood & Body" tab into separate focused pages for better navigation.

## Features

- **Separate MeatSpace pages** — split the "Blood & Body" tab into 4 independent pages: Age (epigenetic), Blood (tests), Body (composition), and Eyes (prescriptions)
- **Dedicated sidebar nav entries** — each health domain now has its own sidebar link with distinct icons (Clock, HeartPulse, Scale, Eye)
- **Correct overview tile navigation** — overview health tiles now link directly to their respective pages instead of all pointing to Blood

## Fixes

- **Fix "Provider not found" when changing default AI provider** — `PUT /active` was caught by the wildcard `PUT /:id` route, treating "active" as a provider ID; added explicit route before the wildcard (fixes #32)
- **Fix unhandled promise rejection on provider switch** — `handleSetActive` now catches errors gracefully instead of letting them bubble as unhandled rejections
- **Fix CoS auto-starting on fresh installs** — sample state now sets `alwaysOn: false` so CoS doesn't immediately queue agent tasks on new machines without configured providers/CLIs
- **Remove example apps from fresh install** — sample `apps.json` now only includes the PortOS self-reference app instead of two placeholder apps with fake paths
- **Clear sample tasks** — removed example pending task from `data.sample/TASKS.md` to prevent agent spawning on first boot
- **Remove Brain sample data** — cleared all example people (Sarah Chen, etc.), projects, ideas, admin tasks, inbox items, digests, and reviews from `data.sample/brain/` so fresh installs start with an empty brain
