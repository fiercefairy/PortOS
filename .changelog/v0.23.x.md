# Release v0.23.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

PortOS Federation — connect and monitor multiple PortOS instances across your Tailscale network.

## Features

### Instances page (Federation)
- **Peer registration** — manually add other PortOS instances by Tailscale IP address
- **Health monitoring** — automatic 30s polling shows memory, CPU, uptime, app count, and CoS agent status for each peer
- **Self identity** — each instance auto-generates a unique ID and editable display name on first run
- **Query proxy** — send arbitrary `/api/*` requests to remote peers from the local UI (Health, Apps, CoS Status presets included)
- **Real-time updates** — Socket.IO subscription pushes peer status changes to the Instances page without polling the client
- **Server-to-server architecture** — local server proxies all remote requests; clients never talk to peers directly (no CORS issues)
- **Health endpoint enrichment** — `/api/health` and `/api/health/system` now include `hostname` and `instanceId` fields for peer identification

### Peak productivity insight in ActionableInsights
- **Proactive productivity suggestion** surfaces in the ActionableInsights banner when the current hour is a peak productivity window and there are pending tasks
- Uses the same hourly success rate analysis as QuickSummary's optimal time indicator
- Shows current hour's success rate and encourages tackling tasks during high-performance windows

### Safer defaults for new installations
- All 13 CoS self-improvement tasks default to **disabled** — users opt in to the ones they want
- Master `selfImprovementEnabled` switch defaults to off
- Default autonomy level changed from `manager` to `standby`

## Changed

- Sidebar nav items are now alphabetically ordered (after Dashboard/CyberCity section)
- Chief of Staff sub-items alphabetized

### CI/CD
- Removed automatic version bumping from CI — versions are now bumped manually in commits
- Release workflow still archives changelogs and syncs dev branch after release
