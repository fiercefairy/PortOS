# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Ship five next actions that transform PortOS from siloed features into a connected, protected, and searchable system
**Current focus:** MILESTONE COMPLETE — all 5 phases shipped (genome migration, backup/recovery, Apple Health, cross-domain insights, unified search)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 5 (Unified Search) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (05-02 complete)
Status: ALL PLANS COMPLETE — milestone v1.0 fully shipped
Last activity: 2026-02-27 -- Plan 05-02 complete (Cmd+K overlay, useCmdKSearch hook, CmdKSearch portal modal, Layout mount)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~10 min
- Total execution time: ~0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-genome-migration-cleanup | 1 | 108s | 108s |
| 02-data-backup-recovery | 2 | 255s + ~10min | ~7min |
| 03-apple-health-integration | 1 | 210s | 210s |
| 03-apple-health-integration | 2 | 180s | 180s |
| 03-apple-health-integration | 3 | ~15min | ~15min |
| 04-cross-domain-insights-engine | 1 | 174s | 174s |
| 04-cross-domain-insights-engine | 2 | 238s | 238s |
| 05-unified-search | 1 | ~8min | ~8min |
| 05-unified-search | 2 | ~15min | ~15min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 03-01 (210s), 03-02 (180s), 03-03 (~15min), 04-01 (174s), 04-02 (238s)
- Trend: stable (~2-15 min/plan)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Keyword-first search for M46 (semantic search layers on later)
- Local external drive for backup (NAS/rsync added later)
- Build Apple Health endpoint before purchasing app
- Genome-to-health and taste-to-identity as priority insight domains
- Used PATHS.meatspace (existing constant) for genome migration — no new constant needed
- Moved genome data files with mv (not copy) to prevent stale digital-twin copies
- createReadStream only available on 'fs' not 'fs/promises' — fixed import in backup.js
- Exit code 24 from rsync means files vanished mid-transfer (acceptable for active systems)
- startBackupScheduler is async (reads settings) — called with .catch() in index.js like other async inits
- [Phase 02-data-backup-recovery]: RestorePanel uses inline expandable within snapshot row — avoids URL-less modal per CLAUDE.md
- [Phase 02-data-backup-recovery]: Restore requires dry-run preview before enabling Restore button — prevents accidental destructive restore
- [Phase 02-data-backup-recovery plan 02]: BackupWidget placed in Dashboard Row 4 (system-status row) alongside SystemHealthWidget
- [Phase 02-data-backup-recovery plan 02]: SnapshotList fetches lazily (only when expanded) to avoid unnecessary API calls
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration plan 01]: extractDateStr uses substring(0,10) not Date() to avoid timezone shift on Apple Health timestamps
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration plan 01]: Dedup key is full date string, not extracted YYYY-MM-DD, to distinguish multiple same-day readings
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration plan 01]: /health/system renamed to /health/details to avoid redundancy with /api/system mount point
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration plan 01]: getDailyAggregates uses per-metric strategy (step_count sums, heart_rate averages Avg, sleep takes totalSleep, default averages qty)
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration]: SAX non-strict mode handles malformed Apple Health XML; error handler clears parser and resumes
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration]: multer diskStorage for XML upload avoids OOM on 500MB+ files — tmpdir write, no in-memory buffering
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration]: uploadAppleHealthXml uses raw fetch() not request() helper — helper hardcodes Content-Type application/json which breaks multipart/form-data
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration plan 03]: Correlation text summaries computed via pure data math (no LLM) — zero latency, deterministic
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration plan 03]: 14-day minimum threshold guard prevents misleading correlations with sparse data
- [Phase 03-apple-health-integration plan 03]: Stethoscope icon chosen for Health tab — Activity used by Overview, HeartPulse used by Blood & Body
- [Phase 04-cross-domain-insights-engine plan 01]: CONFIDENCE_FROM_STATUS uses "Evidence" and "Risk Marker" language — never causation language — per INS-01 requirement
- [Phase 04-cross-domain-insights-engine plan 01]: CATEGORY_BLOOD_MAP covers 6 categories; other genome categories get empty matchedBloodValues (no blood analyte mapping available)
- [Phase 04-cross-domain-insights-engine plan 01]: LLM generation functions return { available: false, reason } (not throw) when provider unavailable or no taste data
- [Phase 04-cross-domain-insights-engine plan 01]: narrativeRefresh preserves previousText + previousGeneratedAt for client-side diff rendering
- [Phase 04-cross-domain-insights-engine plan 02]: Insights nav entry is a single item (not expandable) — sub-tabs navigate from within the page
- [Phase 04-cross-domain-insights-engine plan 02]: /insights added to isFullWidth paths in Layout.jsx for proper full-height rendering matching MeatSpace pattern
- [Phase 04-cross-domain-insights-engine plan 02]: CrossDomainTab diff only shows after refresh triggers and previousText differs (trimmed comparison prevents false diffs)
- [Phase 05-unified-search plan 01]: Health adapter is synchronous (no I/O) — searches known metric names + display aliases in-memory, no file reads needed
- [Phase 05-unified-search plan 01]: fanOutSearch returns only non-empty sources — zero-result sources are omitted from the response
- [Phase 05-unified-search plan 01]: Brain adapter fans out to 5 sub-types via Promise.allSettled and merges into a single source block
- [Phase 05-unified-search plan 02]: CmdKSearch renders via createPortal(document.body) for z-index isolation above sidebar
- [Phase 05-unified-search plan 02]: Flat result list derived from grouped sources to keep focusedIndex as a simple number across all categories
- [Phase 05-unified-search plan 02]: 300ms debounce + 2-char minimum matches Spotlight/Raycast UX conventions
- [Phase 05-unified-search plan 02]: Top 3 results per source by default with Show More per-source expansion
- [Phase 05-unified-search plan 02]: Cmd+K fires in input context intentionally — search is a global action with highest priority (Spotlight parity)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4: Curating scientifically grounded correlation rules is domain work, not just engineering
