# Release v1.11.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Alcohol data table: view and edit all imported drink entries with inline editing, pagination, and standard drink recalculation.

## Features

- **Full editable alcohol data table** replacing the 7-day recent drinks view — browse all 700+ daily entries grouped by date with day totals, inline edit any drink (name, oz, ABV, count), and see standard drinks recalculate in real-time
- **Paginated display**: shows 50 days at a time with "Load More" for full history, scrollable with sticky header
- **Update drink API**: `PUT /api/meatspace/alcohol/log/:date/:index` with partial update schema (any combination of name, oz, abv, count)
- 3 new tests for drink update logic with standard drink recalculation verification
- **Eye prescription CRUD**: Add, edit, and delete eye exams with inline form — tabular display showing SPH, CYL, and AXIS for both eyes
- Eye exam API: `PUT /api/meatspace/eyes/:index` and `DELETE /api/meatspace/eyes/:index`

## Improvements

- **Grams-per-day alcohol tracking** — summary cards and chart now show grams of pure alcohol as the primary metric (1 std drink = 14g), with longevity-based thresholds: 10g/day target (green), 40g/day danger zone (red)
- **Chart unit toggle** — switch between Grams and Drinks views with reference lines for each unit's thresholds
- **Day of week labels** in alcohol data table — each date group shows abbreviated 3-letter day code for quick pattern recognition

## Fixes

- **TSV import drink count bug** — import was storing raw serving count alongside already-multiplied total oz, causing double-counted standard drinks across 390 entries; fixed import to always set count=1 since oz already represents total, and corrected all existing data
- **Eye prescription display** now correctly reads flat field names (`leftSphere`, `rightCylinder`, etc.) instead of broken nested object access — prescriptions were showing as empty cards with only dates

## Removed

- **Mercury exposure tracking** removed from nutrition dashboard, TSV import, health service, and daily log data
