# Release v1.13.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Redesigned MeatSpace overview as a compact grid dashboard surfacing all health data above the fold. Removed unused nutrition tracking.

## Features

- **MeatSpace overview dashboard redesign** — compact 3-row grid layout replacing the tall single-column stack: hero row with inline death clock countdown + LEV tracker, vitals row with age/remaining/healthy years, and 7 clickable health tiles (Alcohol, Body, Blood, Epigenetic, Eyes, Lifestyle, Data) that navigate to their respective tabs
- **Expanded data fetching** — overview now calls 6 endpoints in parallel (overview, alcohol, body, blood, epigenetic, eyes) to populate health tiles with live metrics

## Improvements

- **Genome moved to MeatSpace** — relocated Genome tab, components (GenomeCategoryCard, EpigeneticTracker), and API routes from Digital Twin to MeatSpace where physical health data belongs
- **Death clock date + LEV badge** — overview countdown now shows the projected death date inline, with a green "+LEV" indicator when life expectancy exceeds longevity escape velocity
- **Update scripts auto-restart PM2** — `update.sh` now restarts PM2 apps after pulling and installing deps; added `update.ps1` for Windows parity

## Fixes

- **Lifestyle BMI validation** — `bmi: null` no longer causes validation error when saving lifestyle questionnaire (Zod schema now accepts `.nullable()`)

## Removed

- **Nutrition tracking** — removed NutritionTab component, sidebar nav item, page tab, API endpoints (`/meatspace/nutrition`, `/meatspace/nutrition/daily`), server service functions, and associated tests; sparse historical data was not being actively tracked
