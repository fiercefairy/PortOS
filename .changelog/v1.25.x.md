# Release v1.25.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Reusable ProcessesTab component with per-app process views and a bug fix for clearing failed AI runs.

## 🎉 Features

- **App Processes Tab**: Each app's detail view now has a "Processes" tab showing only that app's PM2 processes with live logs, restart/stop/start controls
- **Reusable ProcessesTab**: Extracted process management UI into a shared component used by both the DevTools Processes page and app detail views

## 🐛 Fixes

- **Clear Failed Runs**: Fixed "Only filter=failed is supported" error when clicking Clear Failed on the DevTools Runs page — client was sending wrong query parameter

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Alphabetical app tabs**: App detail tabs are now alphabetically ordered (Automation, Documents, Git, GSD, Processes, Tasks)
