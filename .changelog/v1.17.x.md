# Release v1.17.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Split monolithic "Blood & Body" tab into separate focused pages for better navigation.

## Features

- **Separate MeatSpace pages** — split the "Blood & Body" tab into 4 independent pages: Age (epigenetic), Blood (tests), Body (composition), and Eyes (prescriptions)
- **Dedicated sidebar nav entries** — each health domain now has its own sidebar link with distinct icons (Clock, HeartPulse, Scale, Eye)
- **Correct overview tile navigation** — overview health tiles now link directly to their respective pages instead of all pointing to Blood

## Fixes

- **Fix "Provider not found" when changing default AI provider** — `PUT /active` was caught by the wildcard `PUT /:id` route, treating "active" as a provider ID; added explicit route before the wildcard (fixes #32)
- **Fix unhandled promise rejection on provider switch** — `handleSetActive` now catches errors gracefully instead of letting them bubble as unhandled rejections
