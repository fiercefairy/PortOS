# Release v1.28.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Fix brain inbox classification timeouts caused by model flag not being passed to CLI providers.

## 🐛 Fixes

- **Brain classifier model selection**: CLI providers (claude, codex, gemini) now receive `--model` flag so the configured model is actually used — previously the model parameter was ignored, defaulting to the CLI's own default (often a slower model), causing classification to time out after 5 minutes

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Classification timing logs**: Brain classifier now logs how long AI calls take (e.g., `🧠 AI responded in 3.2s`) for easier performance debugging
