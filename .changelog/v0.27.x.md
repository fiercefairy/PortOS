# Release v0.27.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Enhanced agent completion toast with expandable output view and smart dismiss behavior.

## Features

### Expandable output in agent feedback toast
- Agent completion toast now includes a Show/Hide toggle to expand the full markdown output summary
- Reuses shared `OutputBlocks` component (extracted from `AgentCard`) for consistent rendering
- When expanded: auto-dismiss is paused and dismiss button is hidden — must provide thumbs up/down feedback or collapse first
- When collapsed: retains original 15s auto-dismiss behavior with manual dismiss option
- Output fetched via API on demand if not included in socket event data
- Toast widens from 320px to 480px when expanded, with scrollable output (max 400px height)
