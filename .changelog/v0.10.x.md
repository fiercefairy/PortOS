### AI Provider Usage Limit Handling & Fallback
- **Usage Limit Detection**: Agents now detect provider usage limit errors (e.g., "You've hit your usage limit. Upgrade to Pro or try again in 1 day 1 hour 33 minutes") and mark providers as temporarily unavailable
- **Provider Status Tracking**: New `providerStatus.js` service tracks provider availability, usage limits, and estimated recovery times with persistence across server restarts

- **API Endpoints**: New `/api/providers/status`, `/api/providers/:id/status`, and `/api/providers/:id/status/recover` endpoints for status management

### CoS Learning Data Reset
- **Reset Skipped Task Types**: Added ability to reset learning data for auto-paused task types that have been stuck due to historical failures (e.g., task types with 5% success after 200+ attempts from a now-fixed bug)
- **Clean Metric Subtraction**: Resetting a task type correctly subtracts its metrics from totals and cleans up associated error patterns, giving it a fresh start

- **Grace Period Configuration**: New `rehabilitationGracePeriodDays` config option allows tuning how long skipped tasks wait before being retried
- **Periodic Rehabilitation Check**: During task evaluation, CoS checks every ~100 evaluations (~2 hours) for task types eligible for rehabilitation
- **Learning Data Reset**: When a task type is rehabilitated, its historical learning data is reset, giving it a clean slate to prove the underlying issue was fixed
- **Status Visibility**: New `getSkippedTaskTypesWithStatus()` function provides detailed info about skipped tasks including days until rehabilitation eligibility

## 🔧 Improvements

### Release Process
- **Rich Release Descriptions**: GitHub releases now support detailed, categorized changelogs
- **Flexible Workflow**: Developers can choose between detailed changelogs or auto-generated commit logs
- **Consistency**: Standardized release note format across all versions
- **Version Substitution**: Workflow automatically replaces version placeholders with actual release version
- **Git History Preservation**: Pattern files renamed using `git mv` to maintain full file history

### Developer Experience
- **Clear Guidelines**: Comprehensive documentation in `.changelog/README.md`
- **Easy Maintenance**: Simple process for creating and updating release notes
- **Tool Integration**: Instructions for using `gh` CLI to manage releases

## 🐛 Fixes

### Media Page Debug Logs Cleanup
- **Removed Debug Console Logs**: Cleaned up 10 `console.log` statements from `client/src/pages/Media.jsx` that were left over from AudioContext debugging - improves production code quality

### CoS Agent Provider/Model Validation
- **Provider Override Support**: Tasks specifying a `provider` in metadata now correctly use that provider instead of always using the active provider
- **Model Compatibility Validation**: When spawning agents, models are now validated against the target provider's model list - prevents invalid combinations like using Claude models with the Codex CLI provider
- **Graceful Fallback**: Invalid model/provider combinations fall back to the appropriate tier model for the actual provider with a warning log

### CoS Learning-Based Model Selection
- **Adaptive Model Upgrades**: Model selection now consults historical task performance data - task types with <60% success rate are automatically upgraded to heavier models (Opus)
- **Smarter Resource Allocation**: CoS learns from past failures and allocates more capable models to struggling task types, improving overall success rates
- **Transparent Logging**: Model selection logs now include learning-based reasons (e.g., "learning-suggested - task type has 45% success rate")

### System Task Deletion
- **Task Type Detection**: Deleting system tasks (prefixed with `sys-`) now correctly passes `type=internal` to the API, fixing "Task not found" errors when deleting auto-generated investigation tasks

## 🗑️ Removed

### Dead Code Cleanup
- **Legacy Service Files**: Removed three unused `.old.js` files from `server/services/`:
  - `providers.old.js` - superseded by current `providers.js`
  - `promptService.old.js` - superseded by current `promptService.js`
  - `runner.old.js` - superseded by AI Toolkit's runner service
- These files were unreferenced throughout the codebase and represented ~1,220 lines of dead code
