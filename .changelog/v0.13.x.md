# Release v0.13.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

This release expands the genome dashboard with comprehensive cancer predisposition markers and adds user feedback collection for completed agent tasks.

## Features

### Agent Task Feedback System
- **Thumbs up/down feedback buttons** on completed agent cards — users can rate task outcomes as positive, negative, or neutral
- **Optional comment input** for more detailed feedback with neutral rating option
- **Feedback statistics API** (`GET /api/cos/feedback/stats`) aggregating satisfaction rate, breakdown by task type, and recent comments
- **Real-time visual feedback** confirmation with toast notifications and button state changes
- Persisted in agent state for historical analysis and learning improvements
- Addresses COS-GOALS.md requirement: "User satisfaction feedback" metric tracking

### Digital Twin — Cancer Predisposition Marker Expansion
- **37 new cancer predisposition SNP markers** added across 7 new cancer subcategories plus expanded tumor suppression and thyroid categories
- **Breast & Ovarian Cancer** (12 markers): FGFR2, TOX3, MAP3K1, 2q35, LSP1, 5p12/FGF10, SLC4A7, CASP8 (protective), 3 BRCA Ashkenazi founder mutations (FDA-approved), BNC2 (ovarian)
- **Prostate Cancer** (6 markers): Three independent 8q24 region signals, MSMB, HNF1B, 17q24
- **Colorectal Cancer** (4 markers): SMAD7 (protective), EIF3H, 11q23, GREM1
- **Lung Cancer** (3 markers): CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNA3/5 region — nicotinic receptor variants affecting smoking intensity and lung cancer risk
- **Melanoma** (2 markers): MC1R R160W, TYRP1
- **Bladder Cancer** (3 markers): NAT2 slow acetylator tag, 8q24, TP63
- **Digestive Cancer** (3 markers): ABO blood group (pancreatic), NR5A2 (pancreatic protective), MUC1 (gastric)
- **Tumor Suppression** expanded (3 markers): TERT multi-cancer, MDM2 p53 attenuator, CHEK2 DNA damage response
- **Thyroid** expanded (2 markers): NKX2-1, DIRC3 papillary thyroid cancer
- **Reorganized cancer categories**: Replaced single `cancer_risk` with specific cancer type subcategories for clearer organization; moved KRAS to tumor suppression (multi-cancer)
