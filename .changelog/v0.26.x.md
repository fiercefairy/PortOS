# Release v0.26.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Dashboard layout redesign, compact app cards, UI polish, and button sizing cleanup.

## Improvements

### Dashboard layout redesign
- Apps grid moved directly under quick-entry widgets for faster access
- System Health, Quick Stats, and Decision Log consolidated into a single 3-column row
- Activity Streak and Hourly Heatmap bundled in a compact 3-column row (1+2 split)
- App cards grid now scales to 4/5/6 columns at lg/xl/2xl breakpoints

### Compact app cards
- Card padding, icon, font sizes, port badges, and action buttons all shrunk for denser grid display
- Buttons reduced from `px-4 py-2 min-h-10 text-sm` to `px-2.5 py-1 text-xs`
- "Open UI" shortened to "Open"

### Compact buttons app-wide
- Browser page Launch/Stop/Restart/Go/Save buttons reduced from oversized `px-5 py-2.5 min-h-[40px]` to `px-3 py-1.5 text-sm`
- Standardized button sizing across Memory tab, Memory edit modal, Digital Twin overview, and Accounts tab

### Rename Agents → Social Agents
- Nav label updated to "Social Agents" and moved to correct alphabetical position (between Shell and Uploads)
- Page title updated to match

## Fixes

- **Collapsed sidebar icon alignment** — collapsible nav sections had misaligned icons when the sidebar was collapsed; an empty chevron/badge wrapper div created a 12px gap offset
