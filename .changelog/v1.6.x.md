# Release v1.6.x - Changelog

Released: Unreleased

## Overview

Folder picker improvements for Windows: drive selector, home directory quick-nav, and error handling.

## Features

### FolderPicker: Windows drive navigation
- Added drive selector bar showing all available Windows drives (A–Z) so users can navigate between drives without typing paths
- Active drive is visually highlighted with the accent color
- Drive list is fetched from the server and only shown on Windows

### FolderPicker: Home directory shortcut
- Added a Home button in the path bar to quickly jump to the user's home directory (`~`)
- Server resolves `~` to the actual home directory path

## Fixes

### FolderPicker: Error state handling
- Directory load errors now display inline with a message and "Go to default directory" recovery button instead of silently failing
- Select button is disabled when no path is loaded
