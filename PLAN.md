  name: z.string().min(1),
  port: z.number().int().min(1).max(65535).nullable().optional(),
  description: z.string().optional()
});

// Added to appSchema
processes: z.array(processSchema).optional()
```

- Vite processes use `npx vite --host --port XXXX` in args
- No stray port references in .env or vite.config

---

### M19: CoS Agent Runner

Isolated PM2 process for spawning Claude CLI agents, preventing orphaned processes when portos-server restarts.

#### Problem
When multiple CoS agents are running and the main portos-server restarts (due to code changes, crashes, or manual restart), child processes spawned via `child_process.spawn()` become orphaned. The parent loses track of them because the `activeAgents` Map is in memory.

#### Solution
A separate `portos-cos` PM2 process that:
1. Runs independently from `portos-server`
2. Manages agent spawning via HTTP/Socket.IO bridge
3. Doesn't restart when `portos-server` restarts
4. Maintains its own state file for PID tracking

#### Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐     HTTP/Socket.IO    ┌─────────────────┐
│  portos-server  │ ──────────────────►   │   portos-cos    │
│    (5554)       │     spawn/terminate   │     (5558)      │
│                 │ ◄──────────────────   │                 │
│  subAgentSpawner│     events/output     │  cos-runner     │
└─────────────────┘                       └────────┬────────┘
                                                   │
                                                   │ spawn
                                                   ▼
                                          ┌───────────────┐
                                          │  Claude CLI   │
                                          │   Processes   │
                                          └───────────────┘
```

### M20: AI Provider Error Handling

Enhanced error extraction and display for AI provider execution failures, with automatic CoS investigation task creation.

#### Problem
When AI provider executions fail (e.g., invalid model, API errors), the devtools/runner UI only showed exit codes without meaningful error information, making debugging difficult.

#### Solution
1. **Error Extraction**: Extract meaningful error details from CLI output
2. **Error Categorization**: Classify errors by type (model_not_found, auth_error, rate_limit, etc.)
3. **Suggested Fixes**: Provide actionable suggestions for each error category
4. **CoS Integration**: Create investigation tasks for actionable failures
5. **UI Enhancement**: Display error details, category, and suggestions in history list

#### Error Categories
| Category | Description | Actionable |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| model_not_found | Model doesn't exist in provider | Yes |
| auth_error | API key invalid or unauthorized | Yes |
| api_error | Generic API request failure | Yes |
| rate_limit | Rate limiting triggered | No (transient) |
| quota_exceeded | Billing/quota issue | Yes |
| network_error | Connection refused/timeout | No (transient) |
| timeout | Process timeout (SIGTERM) | No |
| command_not_found | CLI tool not installed | Yes |
| permission_denied | File/directory access denied | Yes |
| unknown | Unrecognized error pattern | No |

---

### M21: Usage Metrics Integration

Enhanced usage tracking to capture all AI provider executions across CoS agents and DevTools runner.

#### Problem
The Usage page existed but displayed zero data because the tracking functions were never called when runs executed.

#### Solution
1. **Usage Service Integration**: Added `recordSession` and `recordMessages` calls to runner.js and subAgentSpawner.js
2. **Mobile Responsive Design**: Redesigned usage page with responsive Tailwind breakpoints
3. **Unified Tracking**: Both manual DevTools runs and CoS agent executions now record usage

#### Data Tracked
| Metric | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Sessions | createRun, createAgentRun | Incremented when any AI execution starts |
| Messages | run completion | Recorded on successful run completion |
| Tokens | Output-based estimate | ~4 characters per token estimation |
| Provider Stats | Per provider | Sessions, messages, tokens by provider |
| Model Stats | Per model | Sessions, messages, tokens by model |
| Daily Activity | Per day | Sessions, messages, tokens by date |
| Hourly Activity | 24-hour array | Session counts by hour of day |

---

### M22: Orphan Auto-Retry

Automatic retry for orphaned agents with investigation task creation after repeated failures.

#### Problem
When agents become orphaned (server restart, runner crash, etc.), the task remained stuck and the system didn't automatically retry or investigate the issue.

#### Solution
1. **Auto-Retry**: Reset orphaned tasks to pending for automatic retry (up to 3 attempts)
2. **Retry Tracking**: Track retry count in task metadata (orphanRetryCount)
3. **Investigation Task**: After max retries, create auto-approved investigation task
4. **Evaluation Trigger**: Trigger task evaluation immediately after orphan cleanup

#### Retry Flow
```
Agent Orphaned
    └─► cleanupOrphanedAgents() marks agent as completed
    └─► handleOrphanedTask() checks retry count
        ├─► retryCount < 3: Reset task to pending, trigger evaluation
        └─► retryCount >= 3: Mark task blocked, create investigation task
```

---

### M24: Goal-Driven Proactive Mode

Makes CoS proactive and goal-driven, spending more time working and less time idle.

#### Solution

1. **COS-GOALS.md Mission File**: Created `data/COS-GOALS.md` with mission statement, active goals, task priorities
2. **Always-Working Behavior**: CoS ALWAYS returns work - falls back to self-improvement if apps are on cooldown
3. **Expanded Task Types**: Added 4 new self-improvement types (cos-enhancement, test-coverage, documentation, feature-ideas)
4. **Configuration Changes**: Shorter intervals (1m eval, 30m cooldown), MEDIUM priority for idle reviews

---

---

### M29: Comprehensive App Improvement

Extended the CoS self-improvement system to apply the same comprehensive analysis to managed apps (not just PortOS itself).

#### Problem
The CoS had a sophisticated self-improvement system with 12 different analysis types for PortOS itself, but managed apps only received simple idle reviews.

#### Solution
Created an app-agnostic self-improvement system that applies comprehensive analysis to any managed app:

1. **10 Analysis Types for Apps**: Security audit, code quality, test coverage, performance, accessibility, console errors, dependency updates, documentation, error handling, and TypeScript typing
2. **Rotation System**: Each app tracks its last improvement type and rotates through all 10 types
3. **App Activity Tracking**: Extended `appActivity.js` to track `lastImprovementType` per app
4. **Configuration Toggle**: New `comprehensiveAppImprovement` config option (default: true)

---

### M30: Configurable Task Intervals

Per-task-type scheduling: daily, weekly, once, on-demand; schedule UI tab; execution history tracking.

---

### M31: LLM-based Memory Classification

Replaced pattern-based memory extraction with intelligent LLM-based evaluation using local LM Studio.

See [Memory System](./docs/features/memory-system.md#llm-based-classification-m31) for details.

---

### Security Audit (2026-01-08)

Comprehensive security audit performed by CoS Self-Improvement agent.

#### Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

1. **Command Injection in Git Service** (CRITICAL - FIXED)
   - File: `server/services/git.js`
   - Fix: Replaced `exec()` with `spawn()` and `shell: false`, added path validation

2. **Path Traversal in Screenshots Route** (HIGH - FIXED)
   - File: `server/routes/screenshots.js`
   - Fix: Added `sanitizeFilename()` and path validation

#### No Issues Found (Secure Patterns)
- Command execution uses allowlist
- PM2 operations use spawn with shell: false
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- No dangerouslySetInnerHTML in React
- API keys stored server-side only
- JSON content type required for mutations

---

### M27: CoS Capability Enhancements (2026-01-08)
