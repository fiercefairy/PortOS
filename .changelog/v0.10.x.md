# Release v0.10.x - Changelog Documentation System

Released: 2026-01-XX

## Overview

This release introduces a structured changelog documentation system for creating rich, detailed release notes. The system follows best practices from our other projects and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions to automatically create professional release descriptions.

## 🎉 New Features

### Changelog Documentation System
- **Structured Release Notes**: Added `.changelog/` directory with `v{major}.{minor}.x.md` naming pattern
- **Comprehensive README**: Created detailed documentation for changelog format and best practices
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Updated release workflow to automatically use changelog files with version substitution
- **Fallback Support**: Maintains automatic commit-based changelogs when manual changelog is not provided
- **Automatic File Rename**: Pattern files (e.g., `v0.10.x.md`) automatically renamed to versioned files (e.g., `v0.10.5.md`) on release, preserving git history

### Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE.md Updates**: Added detailed release changelog process instructions
- **Best Practices Guide**: Documented when and how to create changelog files
- **Format Templates**: Provided clear structure with emoji-based sections for visual organization

### Chief of Staff - ETA Countdown
- **Agent ETA Display**: Running agents now show remaining time (e.g., "~2m 30s left") based on historical task completion times
- **Overtime Indicator**: When tasks exceed their typical duration, shows "+Xm Xs over estimate" in yellow with a pulse animation
- **Progress Bar Enhancement**: Improved progress bar with clearer "X% complete" and prominent ETA display
- **Visual Polish**: Slightly thicker progress bars and better typography for the countdown display

## 🔧 Improvements

### Release Process
- **Rich Release Descriptions**: GitHub releases now support detailed, categorized changelogs
- **Flexible Workflow**: Developers can choose between detailed changelogs or auto-generated commit logs
- **Consistency**: Standardized release note format across all versions
- **Version Substitution**: Workflow automatically replaces version placeholders with actual release version
- **Git History Preservation**: Pattern files renamed using `git mv` to maintain full file history

### Developer Experience
- **Clear Guidelines**: Comprehensive documentation in `.changelog/README.md`
- **Easy Maintenance**: Simple process for creating and updating release notes
- **Tool Integration**: Instructions for using `gh` CLI to manage releases

## 🗑️ Removed

### Dead Code Cleanup
- **Legacy Service Files**: Removed three unused `.old.js` files from `server/services/`:
  - `providers.old.js` - superseded by current `providers.js`
  - `promptService.old.js` - superseded by current `promptService.js`
  - `runner.old.js` - superseded by AI Toolkit's runner service
- These files were unreferenced throughout the codebase and represented ~1,220 lines of dead code
